# ronlenserdigital.com v2

React 18 + Vite 6 + Tailwind v4 + Lenis. Zero animation libraries, all motion
is hand written in `src/lib/motion.js`.

## Run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Sections

| Order | Component | File |
|---|---|---|
| Preloader, status bar, nav, menu overlay, cursor | Chrome | `components/Chrome.jsx` |
| Hero, claims marquee, statement | Top | `components/Top.jsx` |
| Work filmstrip, capabilities, process, results | Work | `components/Work.jsx` |
| Testimonials, clients, pricing, contact card, closing | Social | `components/Social.jsx` |

## Motion primitives (`src/lib/motion.js`)

| Hook | Does |
|---|---|
| `useInView` | fires once on enter |
| `useCountUp` | eased number count |
| `useScramble` | glyph decode into text |
| `useMagnetic` | element pulls toward cursor |
| `useClock` | live ticking time |
| `useAvailability` | open / closed vs studio hours |

All of them no-op under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Editing content

Every section reads from a plain array at the top of its file.

- `PROJECTS` and `FILTERS` in `Work.jsx`
- `CAPS`, `STEPS`, `RESULTS` in `Work.jsx`
- `QUOTES`, `CLIENTS`, `OFFERS`, `ROUTES` in `Social.jsx`
- `LINES`, `CLAIMS` in `Top.jsx`
- `LINKS` in `Chrome.jsx`

## Before launch

- [ ] Replace `QUOTES` with real testimonials. They are placeholders.
- [ ] Replace `PROJECTS` and `CLIENTS` with real work.
- [ ] Drop screenshots or video into the Work cards (marked in `Work.jsx`).
- [ ] Add a headshot for the contact card.
- [ ] Verify every number in `RESULTS` is true.
